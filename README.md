# base-angularjs-bs4

A quick and dirty AngularJS + Bootstrap 4 starter solution for Visual Studio.

* AngularJS
* Bootstrap 4
* ASP.NET MVC

There's a gulp file that concatenates all the AngularJS files into one app.js file.


TODO: Remove WebGrease and the native MVC bundling and tidy up scripts.

## Setup

Clone the repo and then change directory into the Client folder.


	npm install
	gulp build


You can also gulp watch while you're editing the javascript files.
